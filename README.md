# Analysis of Kentucky Transportation Cabinet Californa Bearing Ratio Data

The Geatechnical Branch within the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) uses a modified version of the [Californa Bearing Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_bearing_ratio)(CBR) to quantify the strength of subsurface soils for pavement design. The test involves compacting a sample in a mold, soaking that sample, and then penetracting the sample with a piston. A bearing ratio is calculated at standard refrence stresses and penetration depths to obtain a number representing the strength of the soil sample as compared to a standard crushed rock material. So, a soil having a CBR of 16 supports 16 percent of the load that would be supported by the standard crushed rock material, per unit area, with the same degree of distortion. The preparation is differenct between the standard and kentucky CBR methods and a dicussion of the differences can be found in [Beckham and Allen (1990)](https://uknowledge.uky.edu/ktc_researchreports/484/).

KY CBR values for varying soil types found in Kentucky are show below. The data that will be used was obtained from soil testng for Kentucky Transportation Cabinet roadway project from 2007 to 2017.
